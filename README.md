# EU Member Country Data

This repository contains some data files and utilities related to the member
countries of the European Union.

While every attempt has been made to ensure that the data is correct,
there may be errors. Use these data at your own risk.

Some of the data originates from the European Union website, mainly the
[EU Member Countries](http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/index_en.htm) 
page (copyright Â© European Union, 1995-2016).

## Data format

The raw data is in CSV files, in the UTF-8 character encoding.
As per [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180),
the files use a CR LF line delimiter. They also have a header row,
used to indicate database column names for further use.
